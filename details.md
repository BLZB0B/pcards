# Work Item Print

Visual Studio Team Services and Team Foundation Server don't make it easy to print work items. This extension will allow printing of single work items, selected multiple work items, or all items in a query. Limit is ~330 work items at once.


## Configure Printing  -  **`NEW in V2.0`** 

A new configuration screen has been added. Select a work item type, choose the fields you want to print, put them in order, and then save. Then print your work items. Configuration is per user.
